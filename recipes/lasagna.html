    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagne are an Italian dish, as a sort of pasta. There are maid of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking.
      Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.
