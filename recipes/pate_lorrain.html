  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Pâté Lorrain is a French dish consisting of marinated meat that is wrapped in puff pastry. In traditional French cuisine, the meat needs to be a mixture of pork and veal, although modern recipes also suggest other varieties, such as rabbit or chicken.
  </p>
  <p>
    The meat is sliced and marinated in a flavorful mixture of wine, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and shallots. Before baking, it is completely enclosed in puff pastry.
  </p>
  <p>
    The recipe for this French classic dates to 1392, and it can be found in Taillevent, the oldest French cookbook published at the time. The best way to serve this French classic is warm or chilled, with salad on the side.
